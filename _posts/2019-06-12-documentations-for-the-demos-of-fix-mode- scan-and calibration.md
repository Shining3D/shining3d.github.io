title: Documentations for the demos of fix-mode scan and calibration.
---

  As mentioned in the last post, the documents for the demo of rapid scan have been provided both in Chinese and English. Now the documentations for the other two demos, i.e. fix scan and calibration, have also been finished. The usage of the APIs has been briefed, and the procedures for the scanning have been illustrated.

In addition to the docs, we are also continuing improving our demos, not only the instructions on the UI but also the codes comments.  

The following is a description of the fix-mode scan and calibration, you can download it if you need it.
