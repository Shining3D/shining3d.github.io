In the past, we provided instructions for rapid scanning demo in SDK. Now we have improved the instructions for fixed scanning and calibration in SDK. Similarly, we have provided Chinese and English explanatory documents for the two demos. In the document, the use process of SDK is described through a complete scanning case, and the parameters in SDK are collated and explained.

The following is a description of the two models, you can download it if you need it.
