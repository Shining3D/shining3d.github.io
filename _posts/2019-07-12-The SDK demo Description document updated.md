title: SDK Demo has been updated.
---

We are very grateful to the developers who have been paying attention to the scan SDK and  pointing out bugs and giving suggestions. After our efforts, we have improved the three demos of scan in terms of interface interaction and function usage. In addition, as our ProSDK which supports Pro/Pro+ has also released, the RapidScan demo also includes the usage of that SDK to manipulate Pro/Pro+. 

Although the basic functions of the previous version of Demo can be realized, the layout of controls on the interface is confusing. We have improved the interface in this edition. The operation flow of Demo is clearer, and the process page can be switched by buttons. At the same time, the control layout is more reasonable, and the operations between steps are effectively summarized and separated，developers may be able to open Demo without looking at the instructions. We fixed the existing bugs and tested it.

In RapidScan Demo, 2X device is used by default. If you want to scan with Pro/Pro+ device, you can click the corresponding device button in the page "Step1 Init" to use it normally.


Following are the documentations of our three Demos.
