title: Rapid scan demo documents in the SDK.
---

It's true that demos are quite important for developers to understand how to use the SDK. So three demos were provided at our official GitHub page along with the 2XSDK itself.

However, the documentations are missing for these demos, leading to some complaints from some third-party develops. We are sorry for that, and are catching up.

At present, we have sorted out an instruction document on the use of rapid scan methods in SDK version 3.1. We provide two versions of PDF usage documentation in English and Chinese. In the document, the process of using the rapid scan model to detail the use of the rapid scan demo in the SDK. At the same time, we have sorted and explained the parameters that will be used in the rapid scan process.

Below is a link to the two pdf documents for rapid scan instructions, you can download it if you need it.
