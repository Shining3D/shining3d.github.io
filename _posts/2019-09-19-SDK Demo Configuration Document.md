# SDK Demo Configuration

  CMake is a powerful tool to organize projects in a universal format. All of our three demos are based on CMake. This post will show you how to use CMake to compile our demos.

Let's take the rapid scan demo as an example. The configuring procedures of CMake are almost the same for all the three demo. The attached documents demonstrate the steps in detail, in both Chinese and English.
