# SDK3.2 release for pro/pro+ and 2x series

We are now glad to announce that the official v 3.2 SDK for our 2X and Pro/Pro+ EinScan 3D cameras has  been released. They have all the interfaces that can be used to fully control the devices, the majority of which is fully tested and is listed in a separate document. The rest of the interfaces should work as well though they are not tested thoroughly due to the limitation of developing time. Please do not hesitate to report issues if encountering any problems when developing with the new sdk.

It is worth noting that the current 2X SDK and Pro SDK are not compatible. The 2X SDK cannot be used with EinScan Pro/Pro+ devices, and the Pro/Pro+ SDK is not supported for use with EinScan-2X series devices. However, we are currently working on developing SDK that are compatible with devices such as EinScan-2X series and EinScan Pro/Pro+.  

Here are downloaded websites and test reports.
